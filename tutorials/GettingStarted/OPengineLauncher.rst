**Build It**

If you prefer to build it yourself, or if you want to modify it, the source code can be found here: https://github.com/TeamOPifex/OPengine.Launcher

**What is it?**

The OPengine Launcher is sort of like a dummy terminal made with `ElectronJS <http://electron.atom.io/>`_ and `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_. It runs all of the command-line methods behind the scenes for you like:

* Git - Pull, Init, etc
* CMake - Generate your project files
* Make - Build with MSVC or the make system

The OPengine can be completely built and run with out the OPengine Launcher, it's there primarily for convenience and ease of entry. Though it's highly recommended that you use it so that you don't miss anything.
